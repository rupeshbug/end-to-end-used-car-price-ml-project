### 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and relationships.  
- Build and compare multiple regression models to predict car prices.  
- Integrate **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model versioning.  
- Package the project into reusable components for training and prediction pipelines.  
- Deploy the trained model on **AWS** for real-time inference.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**
- **MLflow** (for experiment tracking)
- **Flask** (for deployment API)
- **AWS EC2 / S3** (for hosting and storage)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
